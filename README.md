# movie_api

This Node.js and Express API provides movie-related data using REST architecture. It offers a set of endpoints for various data operations and is built to meet modern web development standards. The API uses MongoDB as its database and is modeled with Mongoose for efficient data management.

# Features
REST Architecture: The API follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), with URL endpoints corresponding to various data operations.

Middleware: Utilizes three middleware modules, including body-parser for request data parsing and morgan for logging.

Package.json: The project includes a package.json file to manage dependencies and scripts.

Database: Data is stored in MongoDB, providing flexibility and scalability for managing movie information.

Mongoose: Business logic is modeled using Mongoose, a popular MongoDB ODM (Object-Document Mapping) library.

JSON Format: The API provides movie information in JSON format, making it easy to consume by clients.

Error-Free: The JavaScript code adheres to best practices and is free of errors.

Testing: The API has been thoroughly tested using Postman to ensure functionality and reliability.

Authentication and Authorization: Includes user authentication and authorization code to secure access to protected endpoints.

Data Validation: Implements data validation logic to ensure that incoming data meets specified criteria.

Data Security: Complies with data security regulations to protect sensitive information.

Deployment: The API source code is hosted on a publicly accessible platform, such as GitHub, and deployed to Heroku for online access.
